The name of the database project I have created is Student Database SQL. The main purpose of this project is to manage student-related data efficiently. This project helps to keep records of student information, allowing users to easily add, update, and delete data as needed. It also helps to retrieve data from the database according to different requirements and how the data should be presented.

This database is created using SQL and can be run on any standard SQL engine like MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server. This project contains example queries to demonstrate how to retrieve and manipulate data.

This project includes:

3 Simple Single Table SELECT queries

3 Single Table GROUP BY queries

5 Complex Multi-Table SELECT queries

5 Complex Subquery SELECT queries

5 Advanced Analytics / GROUP BY queries
